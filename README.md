# Anomaly detection implementation in Python - Machine Learning course on Coursera

Implementation in Python of the anomaly detection algorithm taught in the Stanford Machine Learning course on Coursera

3 files: 

- anomaly_detection.py : the implementation of the multivariate gaussian-based anomaly detector
- main.py : a simple file to run the code and create an instance of the Detector class
- ex1data.mat : the data used for the example, there are extracted from Andrew Ng's course
